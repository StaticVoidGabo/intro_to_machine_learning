      "34852    this is a straw man argument  mr merkey  nobody is arguing that federally unverified tribes  clans or groups should be identified as having any kind of federal recognition whats being said here  something that you seem unwilling to accept as even being a valid view  is that those groups claim to have cherokee lineage  in many cases  having verifiable documented evidence to that effect   and as such  they should be figured on the cherokee page  not simply expunged from wikipedia because they dont fall within the very narrow rules defined by the very government that has historically persecuted them if nothing else  they should be included to highlight the controversy that their claim to being cherokee engenders  legally  they may not be recognised cherokees  but anthropologically they are removing non federally recognised groups on the basis of some imagined legal threat would seem to be ridiculous  this is intended  after all  to be an encyclopedia  and thus  encyclopedic  what its not intended to be is a vanity publishing service  and to remove all reference to nonrecognised tribes and the controversy surrounding them would  in my view at least  turn this article into just that  it certainly wouldnt  as you imply  improve wikipedia\n",
